The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application.

This project utilizes:

Express.js: A web application framework that simplifies the development of server-side applications and APIs by providing a set of tools and features for routing, middleware, and request handling.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data, allowing for efficient handling of unstructured and semi-structured data in a document-oriented format.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js that simplifies interaction with the database by providing a schema-based approach, data validation, and query building capabilities.

Postman: A popular API development tool that allows developers to design, test, and document APIs, providing features such as sending HTTP requests, inspecting responses, and automating API workflows.

ESLint: Tool used to help identify and fix coding errors.
